# Pull Request Status Giphy Action v2

This is a fork from [jzweifel's action](https://github.com/jzweifel/pr-status-giphy-action), where I had to change the type of image to get, so it can show on GitHub PR comments.
I have to express my deepest thanks to **jzweifel** by creating this awesome action!

A GitHub Action that displays a random thumbs up or thumbs down gif from Giphy when all checks on a Pull Request complete.

It will automatically clean up an existing comment before making a new one if checks are re-run.
Works best when used in a workflow that runs on the `pull_request` event.

## Usage

```yaml
on: pull_request
name: Pull Request Status Checks
jobs:
  giphy:
    name: PR Status Giphy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: PR Status Giphy
      uses: dgteixeira/pr-status-giphy-action@main
      env:
        GIPHY_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.GIPHY_API_KEY }}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Secrets

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - **Required**.
- `GIPHY_API_KEY` - **Required**. Your secret Giphy Api Key. You can create this key [here](https://developers.giphy.com/dashboard/?create=true).
